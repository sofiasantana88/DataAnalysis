Business Problem: 

Methodology: 

This repository contains two Python-based data analysis projects focused on movie performance and trends, using real-world data scraped from Metacritic and IMDB.
Each project demonstrates data cleaning, database querying, visualization, and storytelling using pandas, matplotlib, and MongoDB.

Project 1: 2018 Movie Analysis
Goal: Explore how movie genre, budget, and sales relate to overall performance.
Highlights
- Web-scraped and merged Metacritic movie data into MongoDB Atlas.
- Created visualizations for runtime, genre trends, and cumulative gross sales.
- Built custom formatters for readable financial scales (K, M, B, T).
- Found that bigger budgets don’t always guarantee higher revenue.

Project 2: 2017 Movie Analysis
Goal: Investigate whether higher budgets and better Metacritic scores lead to stronger opening weekend revenues.
- Combined IMDB and Metacritic datasets for 2017 releases
- Analyzed budget vs. opening revenue and rating vs. revenue correlations
- Discovered that critical reception correlates moderately with box-office success, but high budgets alone don’t ensure profitability
